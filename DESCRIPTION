Description: Computes the degrees of freedom of the lasso,
        elastic net, generalized elastic net and adaptive lasso based
        on the generalized path seeking algorithm.  The optimal model
        can be selected by model selection criteria including Mallows'
        Cp, bias-corrected AIC (AICc), generalized cross validation
        (GCV) and BIC.
